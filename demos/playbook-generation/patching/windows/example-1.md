#### **How to access Playbook Generation?**  
Click on the **'Ansible'** icon on VS Code's Activity Bar  
Under **'Ansible Content Creator'** -> **'Get Started'**  
Under **'Create'** -> **'Playbook with Ansible Lightspeed'**

**ðŸŽ¯ Copy the content below and paste into the textarea.**

```yaml
Apply security updates on Windows hosts and, after that, reboot the hosts if a reboot is required. Register the install update task and print the result after the reboot
```

- Press **"Analyze"** to proceed.
- **Review the suggested steps for your playbook and modify as needed.** _(Prompt refinement)_
- Press **"Generate playbook"** to open a new tab file with the full playbook.

**Note:** _The feature exclusively creates **self-contained** Full Playbooks â€” it does not generate Ansible roles._
